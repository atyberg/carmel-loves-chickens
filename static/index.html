    <h3>What do we do?</h3>
    <p>We are trying to change the current Zoning law of the <a href="http://www.ci.carmel.ny.us/" target="_blank">Town of Carmel, NY</a></p>
    <h3>What is the law?</h3>
    <p>The current <a href= "http://www.ecode360.com/5070236" target="_blank">Zoning law of agricultural activities</a> (chapter 156-17, article 3) states:</p>
    <blockquote>A. Farms, truck gardens, nurseries and other agricultural activities shall be permitted as principal uses, provided that:
      (1) The site size shall be at least five acres.
      (2) No building or structure used for any of the above purposes shall be located closer than 100 feet to any property line. Pens or buildings housing animals or runs shall be located a minimum 150 feet from any property lines.</blockquote>
      <h3>What does this mean?</h3>
      <p>This law prohibits the majority of Carmel residents from owning chickens.  To own and house chickens you have to be classified as a farm, your lot has to be at least 5 acres, and any henhouse or chicken coop has to be 150 feet, or 50 yards away from any property line.
        <h3>Why should we have chickens?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We (residents of Carmel) should be able to to produce healthier eggs for ourselves and our families.</li>
          <li>Chickens eat ticks, ants, spiders, and any other insect/bug they can find.  That's good, isn't it?</li>
          <li>This is for you people who already have chickens.  If your neighbors complain to the town, they will force you to get rid of your chickens.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Do other towns allow chickens?</h3>
